 Unsecured personal loans don't require collateral but require individuals to have fair credit, generally between 580 and 669 to qualify. Loan amounts often range from about $1,000 to $50,000, but the exact range will depend on lender. Some have higher interest rates and may carry origination fees, while others may have no fees and competitive interest rates. 

Borrowers with higher credit scores can qualify for a better interest rate, while those with lower credit scores may only qualify for high-interest-rate loans. Personal loans have fixed monthly payments, which makes them easier to manage compared to loans with short repayment terms.
